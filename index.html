  <h5>Project Idea</h5>

<h5.1>Overview</h5.1>

<p>In today's world use of smart phone has increased. There are number of applications which we use daily.
  We use these apps for chat , study, news and in verious perpose.The various incidents through out the
  whole word have waken us for safety issues.Mostly we see women are not safe in our society.so I am thinking
  to provide them safety via  their smart phones . My project idea is a "WOMEN SAFETY APPLICATION". which can be
  very useful.</p>

  <h5.2>Motivation<h/5.3>

    <p>A United Nations statistical report compiled from govenrment sources showed that more than 200,000 cases per year
    of rapes or another attacks were recorded by police (covered 65 countries) .So there is a huge need of technology in terms
    of women safety.This is more better than safety alarms and other gadgets as this can be easily installed in smart phones on
  free of cost, more interesting thing is that, this is very simple to use and would be work just on one click. </p>

  <h5.4>Features of application </h5.4>

<p>As this would be a smart phone app there would many features of this ,those would be very benificial. A single click on this app
  tells the location of place through GPS then it sends a massage about the location to added contacts and would also make call on first
  shown contact which may very helpful in bad situation.The most powerful feature of this app is that sending massages continuously  until
  clicking the "stop" option. so by using this  victim can be saved quickly. When we would open this app their would be two options safe or unsafe
  clicking on unsafe  massage would be sent to contacts with information of location.</p>

  <h5.5>Tools and Technologies </h5.5>

  <p>For making an app their is need of tools and technologies. For this app a useful tool is MIT App Inventor for selecting components
    and for how these  component should behave.Android SDk for  ensuring the source code and XAMPP  to create a local web server. JDK
    for making program for choosing safe or unsafe. There is also need of HTML5 and CSS3 to operate applicantin across devices.</p>


<h5.6>Skills Required </h5.6 >

  <p> skills of desiging , pragramming language knowledge, knowledge of multiple operation platforms and ome most relevent is backend computing
    which involves security , database mangement and hardware interaction.</p>

  <h6>Outcome</h6>

  <p> If this application become very famous across the nation than we would be able to make our environment women friendly and  number of crimes
    would also be decreased.This project also lead many another innovative and powerful ideas for making such things. Apart from this ,as technology emerge
    it would be possible to upgrade the system and future changes in this app would easily be adaptable.</p>
